# Focused Youtube
Removes distracting elements on Youtube to help you focus on the content you're searching for.

It removes the following elements from Youtube:
- Home page suggestions
- Watch page suggestions
- Comments
- In-video suggestions

The extension is only available for firefox as of now, but I have plans to make it available for chrome as well so stay tuned!
