# Youtube Zen
A Firefox web extension that removes distracting elements on Youtube to help you focus on the content you're searching for.

It removes the following elements from Youtube:
- Home page suggestions
- Watch page suggestions
- Comments
- In-video suggestions

The extension is only available for firefox as of now, but I have plans to make it available for chrome as well so stay tuned!

## Installation
You can install this extension on the [Firefox addon store...](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-zen_/)

OR

By installing it manually by:
1. Downloading the latest release here.
2. Press ```Ctrl+Shift+A``` on Firefox.
3. Click the gear icon in the upper right.
4. Click on "Install Add-on From File..." 
5. Select the ```youtube_zen-x.x.x.xpi``` file in your machine.
